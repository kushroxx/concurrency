ðŸ§µ Multithreading & Concurrency Roadmap

ðŸ”¹ 1. Thread Fundamentals
Topics:

Thread creation (std::thread / std::async)

Joining vs Detaching

Race conditions and undefined behavior



ðŸ”¸ 2. Thread-Safe Data Structures
Topics:

ConcurrentQueue, ConcurrentStack, ConcurrentMap

Lock-based vs lock-free structures


ðŸ”¸ 3. Thread Coordination Patterns
Producer-Consumer
Blocking Queue (bounded/unbounded)

Multiple producers, multiple consumers

Reader-Writer Lock
Shared lock for readers, exclusive lock for writers

ThreadPool
Fixed vs dynamic pool

Task scheduling

Job Scheduler
Delayed execution (e.g., "schedule job after 10s")

Pipeline Manager
Threaded stages (stage 1 â†’ stage 2 â†’ stage 3)


ðŸ”¸ 4. Concurrency Primitives
Topics:

mutex, shared_mutex, condition_variable

atomic, memory_order

future, promise, packaged_task

event or callback registry


ðŸ”¸ 5. Advanced Synchronization
Topics:

Spinlock

Busy-waiting vs blocking

Rate limiting (token bucket, leaky bucket)

Thread-safe Singleton pattern

BFT client pool (Byzantine Fault Tolerant client coordination)


ðŸ”¸ 6. Lock-Free Programming & Memory Model
Topics:

Atomic operations (CAS, fetch_add, etc.)

Memory ordering (memory_order_relaxed, acquire, release)

False sharing

ABA problem

Cache coherence

Implementations without locking (using atomics)


ðŸ”¸ 7. LeetCode-style Coding Problems
Problems to Practice:

Print Odd/Even using 2 threads

Print "FizzBuzz" using 3 threads

Zero-Even-Odd problem

H2O problem (ensure water molecule creation rules)

Traffic Light Controller

Bounded Blocking Queue implementation
