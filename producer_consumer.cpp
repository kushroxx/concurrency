// ‚úÖ Q1: What problem does the producer-consumer pattern solve?
// Your Answer:
// Basically it solves the synchronization issue when two threads are trying to write/read some resource. One thread is updating some variable and the other thread needs to fetch the updated state.

// Refined Answer:
// The producer-consumer pattern solves the problem of coordinating work between threads that produce data (producer) and threads that consume data (consumer), especially when they operate at different speeds. It ensures:

// Thread-safe communication via shared data structures (e.g., queues)

// Synchronization so consumers wait for data and producers wait for space (if bounded)

// Avoids race conditions, busy-waiting, and lost updates

// ‚úÖ Q2: Why do we need a mutex in this setup?
// Your Answer:
// For guarding the tasks queue as it is accessed by both the threads and to prevent data race.

// Perfect. This is concise and correct. A mutex ensures mutual exclusion, so only one thread can access or modify the queue at a time ‚Äî which avoids data races and corruption.

// ‚úÖ Q3: What happens if the producer produces faster than the consumer can consume?
// Your Answer:
// There will be no issue as producer can produce at faster rate but consumer will consume all the elements present in the queue.

// Refined Answer (Important nuance):
// ‚úÖ This is true if the queue is unbounded ‚Äî the consumer will eventually catch up.
// ‚ùóHowever, in real-world systems, queues are often bounded (limited in size) to avoid:

// Out-of-memory issues

// Unbounded resource usage

// So if the producer is faster:

// With unbounded queue ‚Üí backlog grows, but no crash.

// With bounded queue ‚Üí producer must wait (block) when the queue is full ‚Üí this needs extra logic in code (e.g., additional cv.wait() in producer).

// ------------------------xxxxxxxxxxxx--------------------------


// ‚öôÔ∏è Level 2: Intermediate Concepts
// What are spurious wakeups and how do you handle them correctly?

// Why do we use cv.wait(lock, predicate) instead of just cv.wait(lock)?

// What could go wrong if you call notify_one() before the consumer calls wait()?

// üîê Level 3: Synchronization Details
// What's the difference between using:

// std::condition_variable

// Busy waiting with a while loop and sleep?

// Can notify_all() be used instead of notify_one()? What are the trade-offs?

// How would you gracefully shutdown the consumer thread after the producer is done?

// üß† Level 4: Code/Design Questions
// What data structure would you use for the task queue to make it thread-safe?

// What if you had multiple producers and multiple consumers?

// What changes would you make?

// How would you avoid data races?

// Can you design a bounded buffer (fixed-size queue)? How would you make producers wait when it‚Äôs full?

// üöÄ Level 5: Performance & Edge Cases
// What are the implications of holding a lock for too long?

// How would you improve throughput if tasks take time to process?

// How would you detect and handle deadlocks or livelocks in this scenario?
